Description of the Code:
This Java program implements an Exam Seating Arrangement System using the Swing library for a graphical user interface (GUI). 
It allows users to manage a seating arrangement for an exam hall by providing the following functionalities:

Allocate Seat: Assign a student's roll number to a specific seat in the hall.
View Seating Arrangement: Display the current seating arrangement in a scrollable text area.
Reset Seat: Reset a specific seat to "Empty," making it available for allocation.
Exit: Close the application.

The seating arrangement is represented as a 2D array where each element corresponds to a seat in the hall, initialized to "Empty".
The application ensures valid input for rows, columns, and seat positions.
