Description of the Code:
The Exam Seating Arrangement System is a JavaFX-based application designed to efficiently manage and display seating assignments for students during exams.
It provides three user roles—Admin, Student, and Invigilator—each with distinct functionalities. 
The Admin Panel allows administrators to add students, input the number of rows and columns for the seating arrangement, generate a randomized seating plan, 
and view the seating arrangement in a structured table format.
The Student Panel enables students to enter their roll number and check their assigned seat, 
while the Invigilator Panel allows invigilators to verify a student's seat assignment.
